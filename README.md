- **[PPT.pptx](PPT.pptx)**  

This presentation provides a deeper dive into the methodology, architecture, experimental results, and key highlights of the **DermaScan Android App** website .  

## 📊 Research Highlights  

This application was developed as part of the academic research study:  

**“Deep Learning-Based Skin Cancer Detection”**  
**Authors:** Andrew Bala Abhilash Polisetty, Siri Yellu, Akshay Krishna Varma Buddharaju  
**Advisor:** Dr. Sanghoon Lee  

- ✅ Implemented an **ensemble of ResNet152, VGG19, and DenseNet121**, achieving **89% classification accuracy**.  
- ✅ Integrated **Attention U-Net** for lesion segmentation, reaching **87% accuracy**.  
- ✅ Addressed dataset challenges such as **class imbalance and variability** in HAM10000 through **data augmentation and ensemble integration**.
